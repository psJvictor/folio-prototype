                Hello! I'm João Victor, a fullstack developer passionate about building
                exceptional digital experiences. I enjoy creating elegant solutions to complex
                problems through clean, efficient code.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, I specialize in
                building modern web applications using JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node.js, and
                various other frameworks and tools. I'm committed to writing maintainable code and 
                creating intuitive user interfaces.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I started my journey in web development in 2018 and have since worked on a variety of 
                projects, from small business websites to complex enterprise applications. I'm constantly
                learning and exploring new technologies to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving 
                tech landscape.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source
                projects, or sharing my knowledge through blog posts and mentoring.
